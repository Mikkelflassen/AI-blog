              <h2>Demystifying AI: What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
              <p>At its core, Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks encompass a wide range of activities, including problem-solving, decision-making, natural language understanding, and perception.</p>
              <p>AI systems can be classified into two main categories:</p>
              <p><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Also known as Weak AI, this type of AI is designed to perform specific tasks, such as image recognition, language translation, or playing board games like chess or Go.</p>
              <p><strong>General AI:</strong> Also known as Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this type of AI possesses human-like intelligence and can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various domains.</p>
